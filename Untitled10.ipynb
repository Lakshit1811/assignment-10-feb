    "In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. The syntax for opening a file is as follows:\n",
    "file_object = open(file_name, mode)\n",
    "Here, file_name is a string representing the name of the file to be opened, and mode is a string that specifies the mode in which the file is to be opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r' (Read Only): This is the default mode and is used to open a file for reading only. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, a FileNotFoundError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' (Write Only): This mode is used to open a file for writing only. If the file already exists, its content is truncated. If the file does not exist, a new file with the specified name is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' (Append Only): This mode is used to open a file for writing only, but the file pointer is placed at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file with the specified name is created. The write() method appends data to the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' (Exclusive Creation): This mode is used to create a new file for writing only. If the file already exists, a FileExistsError is raised. This mode is used to ensure that a new file is created and there is no risk of overwriting an existing file.\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' (Binary Mode): This mode is used to open a file in binary mode. Binary mode is used to read and write binary files, such as images and audio files.\n",
    "\n",
    "'t' (Text Mode): This mode is used to open a file in text mode. Text mode is used to read and write text files. This is the default mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine the different modes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "'rb': Open a file in binary mode for reading only\n",
    "'wt': Open a file in text mode for writing only (truncating the file if it already exists)\n",
    "'at': Open a file in text mode for writing only (appending to the file if it already exists)\n",
    "'rb+': Open a file in binary mode for reading and writing\n",
    "'wt+': Open a file in text mode for reading and writing (truncating the file if it already exists)\n",
    "'at+': Open a file in text mode for reading and writing (appending to the file if it already exists)"

    "The close() function is used to close an open file. When a file is opened in Python, the operating system reserves some memory to hold the file content and metadata. Closing the file frees up this memory and makes it available for other operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to close a file after you are done working with it because:\n",
    "\n",
    "It ensures that the changes you made to the file are saved and stored on the disk. When a file is opened, changes made to the file are kept in a buffer in memory. When you close the file, the buffer is flushed and the changes are written to the disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "It prevents corruption of the file. If a file is not closed properly, it may be left in an inconsistent state, which can cause data loss or corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps to conserve system resources, such as memory and file handles. If too many files are left open at the same time, the system may run out of resources, which can result in slow performance or crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps to avoid bugs and errors. If you forget to close a file and try to open another file with the same file name, you will get an error, since the previous file is still open.\n",
